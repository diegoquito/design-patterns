Suppose we have a Report class that generates different types of reports (e.g. sales reports, financial reports, marketing reports, etc.). 
To implement the Template Method pattern:

1) We create an abstract base class ReportTemplate that defines the basic skeleton of the report 
and leaves some abstract methods to be implemented by the report-specific subclasses.

2) Then, We create different subclasses that inherit from ReportTemplate and implement the abstract methods 
according to the specific type of report we want to generate. 
For example, here we have a SalesReport subclass that generates sales reports

3) Finally, we can create an instance of the report subclass we want to generate 
and call the GenerateReport() method to generate the complete report.
